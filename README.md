House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

ABSTRACT

House Price Prediction presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting 
house prices using a dataset of historical property prices and features such as size, 
location, and number of rooms. By leveraging machine learning algorithms like 
Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, the goal is to create a 
model that predicts the price of a house accurately based on its features.
The project walks through the entire process, from data preprocessing and feature 
engineering to training, evaluating, and fine-tuning multiple machine learning 
models. Various evaluation metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² are used to 
determine the performance of the models. The system’s final output is a robust 
model capable of predicting house prices with high accuracy, providing significant 
benefits for the real estate industry and individual buyers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The House Price Prediction project leverages advanced data analytics and machine learning to 
transform how property prices are estimated. Accurate predictions of house prices are crucial for individuals, real estate businesses, and financial institutions to make informed decisions. This project utilizes historical and real-time housing data, including features such as location, property size, and market trends, to build a predictive model. The goal is to provide actionable insights into property values, enabling smarter investments, fair pricing, and improved market transparency.In conclusion, the House Price Prediction platform offers a cutting-edge solution for modernizing real estate pricing. By harnessing the power of big data, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics, it delivers precise and data-driven property valuations. This solution benefits buyers, sellers, and market regulators by improving efficiency, reducing biases, and enhancing trust in real estate transactions. Throughpersonalized recommendations and advanced analytics, the platform plays a pivotal role in shaping a smarter, more transparent housing market.
